# UMLExampleProjects
Some example projects I've made for UnrealModLoader

## Installation

Make sure to download the [UnrealModLoader](https://github.com/RussellJerome/UnrealModLoader) source before doing anything with these.

Content/Mods related stuff goes into your UE content folder (if any) and the other folder goes where you put your UML source files.

## Extra Notes

I used Unreal Engine 4.27.2 to create the LogicMods, so there could be incompatibility issues, but hopefully not.
